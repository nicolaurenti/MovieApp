MovieApp - NicolÃ¡s Laurenti

For the realization of this application it was decided to use Clean Architecture and MVVM as
architectures, Coroutines for asynchronous calls and Hilt as DI. As for the screens, it was possible
to make 3/4 screens, which are the following:

Movies: consume three services which were selected the ones that best fit the slogan. For the list
of best recommendations, the id of a movie was chosen at random (1058949) and through the endpoint "
3/movie/1058949/recommendations" the recommendations about that movie were obtained.

Location: the Google maps service was used to show a map, due to lack of time it was not possible to
show the location of the device, which for that should request the "ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" and "
ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" permissions and then through the function

LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient( requireContext()).lastLocation
.addOnSuccessListener { location : Location? ->
// Save location and add marker
}.

(Locations hardcoded)

Images: it was decided to give the user the possibility to select a single image for practicality
reasons and then upload it to Firestore and in the event that there is a previous image, replace it.
It was decided to store the device image in URI format due to its lower storage cost.

The pending screen is the "Profile" screen, this screen should consume the endpoint to bring the
information about the most popular actors ("/person/popular") and show the most popular
